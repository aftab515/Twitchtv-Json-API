# FCC: Use the Twitchtv JSON API

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/aftab515/pen/MWBJKBw](https://codepen.io/aftab515/pen/MWBJKBw).

User Story: I can see whether freeCodeCamp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the freeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv channel.

User Story: If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

Hint: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]

UPDATE: Due to a change in conditions on API usage, Twitch.tv requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use https://twitch-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/ instead of Twitch's API base URL and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.
